**Track**: Gemini Native Hackathon

## 1. The Executive Summary (BLUF)

**The Problem**: Global markets move on central bank policy, but current analysis is slow, qualitative, and backward-looking. Analysts spend 80% of their time reading and 20% interpreting.
**The Solution**: Sahasranshu is an **AI-native quantitative analyst** that doesn't just read documents—it measures the *delta* (rate of change) in regulatory stances instant-by-instant.
**The Ask**: We are building the Bloomberg Terminal for the AI era.

## 2. The Market Opportunity (Why Now?)

*   **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**:
    *   $35B+ Financial Analytics Market.
    *   Target: Hedge Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Compliancetech.
*   **The "Hair on Fire" Problem**:
    *   When the FOMC statement drops, seconds matter.
    *   Human analysts suffer from cognitive bias (anchoring to previous beliefs).
    *   AI Models (until now) hallucinated or missed subtle "Fed speak" nuances.

## 3. The Product: "Delta-First" Intelligence

Sahasranshu isn't a chatbot. It is a **State Comparison Engine**.

### Core Value Proposition
1.  **Quantitative Precision**: We don't say "The Fed is hawkish." We say "The Fed's inflation stance shifted +15% towards hawkishness compared to Nov 7th."
2.  **Causal Reasoning**: It generates *hypotheses* for *why* the change happened (e.g., "Shift due to unexpected labor market cooling").
3.  **Falsifiability**: Every output comes with a "Falsification Criteria"—telling traders exactly what data points would prove the AI wrong.

## 4. The "Secret Sauce" (Technical Edge)

Built natively on **Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview**:

*   **1M+ Token Context Window**: We ingest *entire* historical archives, not just RAG snippets.
*   **Native Multimodality**: Reads charts in PDF annexes as fluently as text.
*   **Structured Output (JSON Mode)**: Pure, reliable data feeds that plug directly into algo-trading engines. No "chatty" fluff.

## 5. Business Model

*   **B2B SaaS**: $5,000/seat/month for institutional license.
*   **API-First**: Pay-per-delta call for quantitative funds integrating into their backtests.
*   **Proprietary Index**: Licensing the "Sahasranshu Hawk/Dove Index" to exchanges.

## 7. The Vision

> "We are moving from *reading* the news to *computing* the news."

Sahasranshu is the first step toward **Autonomous Economic Reasoning**. Today, it tracks the Fed. Tomorrow, it tracks every regulator, central bank, and parliament on Earth.
